# Supabase Best Practices: A Comprehensive Guide

This document outlines best practices for developing with Supabase, covering various aspects from code organization to security and performance.

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

A well-organized codebase is crucial for maintainability and scalability. Here's how to structure your Supabase project:

### 1.1. Directory Structure Best Practices

Adopt a modular structure that separates concerns:

project-root/
├── src/
│ ├── components/ # Reusable UI components
│ ├── pages/ # Page-level components (routes)
│ ├── services/ # Supabase client initialization and data fetching
│ │ ├── supabase.ts # Supabase client initialization
│ │ ├── auth.ts # Authentication-related functions
│ │ ├── database.ts # Database interaction functions
│ ├── utils/ # Utility functions (e.g., date formatting)
│ ├── types/ # TypeScript types and interfaces
│ ├── hooks/ # Custom React hooks
│ ├── styles/ # Global styles and theme
│ └── App.tsx # Main application component
├── migrations/ # Database migrations
├── tests/ # Unit and integration tests
├── .env # Environment variables
└── package.json # Project dependencies

### 1.2. File Naming Conventions

- **Components:** Use PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`).
- **Functions:** Use camelCase (e.g., `fetchUserData`).
- **Variables:** Use camelCase (e.g., `userName`).
- **Files:** Use kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile.tsx`).

### 1.3. Module Organization

- Group related functionalities into modules.
- Use clear and descriptive module names.
- Export only what is necessary from each module to minimize the API surface.

### 1.4. Component Architecture

- Favor small, reusable components.
- Use a component-based approach (e.g., React, Vue.js) to build UIs.
- Separate presentational components from container components to improve reusability and testability.

### 1.5. Code Splitting Strategies

- Use dynamic imports to lazy-load modules.
- Split large components into smaller chunks.
- Implement route-based code splitting to load only the necessary code for each route.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### 2.1. Design Patterns Specific to Supabase

- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract database interactions behind a repository interface for better testability and maintainability.
