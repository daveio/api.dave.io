${validatedRequest.markdown && validatedRequest.networks.includes("mastodon") ? "For Mastodon, preserve or add appropriate Markdown formatting." : ""}
${validatedRequest.networks.includes("threads") ? "For Threads, you can use basic formatting like **bold** and *italic* when appropriate." : ""}

MANDATORY OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES:

1. **MAXIMIZE CHARACTER USAGE**: Always use as much of the character limit as possible for each network. Do NOT split content into more posts than absolutely necessary.

2. **NETWORK-SPECIFIC APPROACH**:
   - **High-limit networks** (Mastodon ~4000+ chars): Try to fit ALL content in ONE post unless it's genuinely too long
   - **Medium-limit networks** (Threads ~500 chars): Use 1-2 posts maximum for typical content
   - **Low-limit networks** (Bluesky/X ~300 chars): Split as needed, but still maximize each post

3. **SMART SPLITTING LOGIC**: Balance character optimization with logical narrative flow:
   - **Primary goal**: Use character limits efficiently (fewer posts when possible)
   - **Secondary goal**: Split at logical narrative boundaries so each post can stand alone
   - For high-limit networks: Only split if content has distinct logical sections OR exceeds character limit
   - For low-limit networks: Split as needed but maintain logical groupings within character constraints

4. **CONTENT INTEGRITY**: When splitting occurs:
   - Break at natural story/argument boundaries (complete thoughts, dialogue breaks, topic shifts)
   - Ensure each post tells a coherent part of the story that makes sense independently
   - Add minimal context to post openings when needed for standalone clarity
   - Use "[...]" to indicate truncated quotes or content
   - Preserve the original voice and meaning
   - Make subtle adjustments for flow (e.g., "This was about..." vs "This was meant to be a post about...")

5. **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
   - Do NOT add thread numbering (handled automatically)
   - Account for threading indicators being added (already factored into limits above)
   - Maintain proper formatting for each platform

SPLITTING PRINCIPLES EXAMPLE:
For a story about "I tested an AI by asking it the same question twice with opposite biases":
- **Logical grouping**: Post 1 (setup + first question), Post 2 (first response), Post 3 (second question), Post 4 (second response + conclusion)
- **Standalone clarity**: Each post makes sense independently with minimal context
- **Narrative flow**: Complete thoughts, not arbitrary character-based cuts
- **Network adaptation**: Different networks will need different post counts based on their character limits - Mastodon might fit the whole story in 1-2 posts, Threads might need 2-3 posts, Bluesky might need all 4 logical sections as separate posts

IMPORTANT: Post counts vary with content length and complexity. Don't target specific numbers - optimize for each network's character limits and logical narrative structure.

REMEMBER: Balance efficiency (fewer posts) with narrative coherence (logical breaks). Each post should tell a complete part of the story.
