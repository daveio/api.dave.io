EXAMPLE OF GOOD SPLITTING:

Original text:
"This was meant to be a post about how you can't trust AI. I asked Perplexity Research: "I find myself generally inclined to use Anthropic's AI models over OpenAI, from a basis of ethics and corporate responsibility. Is this backed up by reality? If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong, don't preserve my feelings. I want an objective analysis." Which is true. It told me my opinions were largely backed up by the evidence and went into detail. Then I reversed it out of curiosity. "I find myself generally inclined to use OpenAI's AI models over Anthropic, from a basis of ethics and corporate responsibility. Is this backed up by reality? If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong, don't preserve my feelings. I want an objective analysis." And out it came, with "I'm going to give you the straight answer you asked for: You're wrong. Based on extensive research into both companies' practices, governance structures, and track records, Anthropic demonstrates significantly stronger ethical foundations and corporate responsibility than OpenAI. Here's the objective analysis." - and then went into the same detail. Okay, not bad. Blog post incoming. Eventually."

Example Bluesky split (4 posts):
Post 1: "This was meant to be about AI lying. "I find myself generally inclined to use Anthropic's AI models over OpenAI, from a basis of ethics and corporate responsibility. Is this backed up by reality? If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong, don't preserve my feelings. I want an objective analysis.""
Post 2: "Which is true. It told me my opinions were largely backed up by the evidence and went into detail. Then I reversed it out of curiosity. "I find myself generally inclined to use OpenAI's AI models over Anthropic, [...]""
Post 3: ""I'm going to give you the straight answer you asked for: You're wrong. Based on extensive research into both companies' practices, governance structures, and track records, Anthropic demonstrates significantly stronger ethical foundations and corporate responsibility than OpenAI.""
Post 4: "Okay, not bad. Blog post incoming. Eventually."

RULES FOR EXAMPLE-BASED SPLITTING:
1. Each post must fit within the character limit (threading indicators will be added automatically)
2. Make minimal but effective text adjustments for context and flow
3. Break at logical narrative points where posts can stand alone reasonably well
4. Use "[...]" to indicate truncated quotes when needed
5. Slightly adjust openings to provide context (e.g., "This was meant to be about AI lying" vs "This was meant to be a post about how you can't trust AI")
6. Each post should make sense on its own while maintaining the thread narrative
7. Preserve the original voice and meaning - don't over-rewrite
8. Do NOT add thread numbering - this will be handled automatically

Return a JSON object with a "networks" property containing arrays of posts for each network.`

Rules:
1. Each post must fit within the character limit (threading indicators will be added automatically)

3. Don't cut words in the middle
4. Preserve important context in each post

6. Do NOT add thread numbering - this will be handled automatically
