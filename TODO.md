# Pending Tasks (deprecated)

- This task list should no longer be used. Instead, use your Linear tool to create tickets.
  - Team name `Dave IO`, team slug `DIO`, tickets beginning `DIO-`.
  - Link: <https://linear.app/dave-io/team/DIO/all>
    - Use this only to help you find the team with the Linear tool.
  - Also read from these tickets to see pending tasks.
- If the Linear tool is inaccessible, stop and ask me to start it for you.
- You should continue to write comments in source files.
  - Instead of a random identifier, mention the ticket ID, eg `DIO-123`.
