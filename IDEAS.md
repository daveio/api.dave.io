# Future Shenanigans for `dave.io`

Ever feel like this site still doesn't do enough? Here are a few mildly ridiculous ideas that fit the vibe and might even be useful. Effort estimates are extremely scientific and not pulled out of thin air. Pinky swear.

## 1. Real-Time Dashboard Widgets

Bring those metrics to life with a snazzy live dashboard. Think WebSockets, animated graphs, and the satisfaction of seeing numbers tick up in real time.

- **Effort**: 2-3 weeks
- **Why**: Because static charts are so last decade.

## 2. AI-Powered Blog Post Summaries

Let the AI read your posts and generate witty TL;DR sections. Great for people who want the gist without all the glorious rambling.

- **Effort**: 1 week
- **Why**: Saves readers time and proves the AI isn't just for alt-text.

## 3. Automated KV Cleanup Scripts

Old metrics cluttering your KV store? A scheduled task could prune stale data and keep things lean.

- **Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Why**: Housekeeping isn't glamorous, but neither is running out of KV space.

## 4. OAuth Integration for Third-Party Clients

Give developers the ability to authenticate via GitHub or Google instead of wrangling JWTs manually. Fancy!

- **Effort**: 2 weeks
- **Why**: Lowers the barrier for API adoption and looks professional.

## 5. Serverless Image Optimization

Automatically resize and compress uploaded images on the fly. Perfect for that alt-text generator and general site snappiness.

- **Effort**: 1-2 weeks
- **Why**: Faster images, happier users, smaller bandwidth bills.
